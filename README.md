solarized-konsole
=================

~~Finally, a correctly implemented solarized theme for konsole.~~

**I've decided to deprecate this repo in favor of https://github.com/phiggins/konsole-colors-solarized**

Why This Exists
---------------

All of the solarized themes for konsole I found had these issues.

 - Colors were incorrectly ordered.
 - Using [Ethan Schoonover's](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) vim configuration files exacerbated above problem.

Using this solarized theme for konsole should result in better integration with Ethan Schoonover's vim files, and by extension, all other solarized themes (mutt, emacs, etc).

Installation
------------

Copy the .colorscheme file into ```~/.kde/share/apps/konsole/```.
